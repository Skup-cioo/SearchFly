(It is worth remembering that fru charges a commission, so it is cheaper to go directly to the airlines)


# Idea
I created this simple program to avoid overpaying for tickets. For now, the number of Destinations is limited, but new ones can be added at any time.<br>
In the program, I used the API of the website https://www.fru.pl/. To which I cordially invite you. In future i think to develop this project and add new features.
